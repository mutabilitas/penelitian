title: tension; contradiction
---

*(originally on twt from 7 jun 2023)* 

need to write a whole essay *[still do]* for this but i identified that we all live in **tension** - trying to survive in this world & its machinations, while also trying to change it. & oftentimes to keep surviving, we make choices that don't serve to change the world in the long run / that keeps the status quo. 

but so long as you are cognizant & transparent of this tension (& don't deny that this cognitive dissonance exists), & you are inching forwards & building capacity to change this unfair world (or helping materially passively), you will then break this tension. *we will remake the world.*

i don't think you don't need to overcompensate abt your strategy of survival & how banal it is. this is especially for ppl working in business/finance/etc... those fields can be useless & are arbitrarily manmade. but it does has value in this world at this moment. you ***do*** have the responsibility to unravel that tension.

(28/11/2024) all of this is probably just a rehashing of the concept of dialectics / dialethia of the self, but i need to make my own discovery in my own words for this. will be doing my readings though, definitely.

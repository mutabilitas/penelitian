*this page in its existence is first and foremost because of [robin sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/colophon/) ☆⌒(*＾-゜)v* <br />
*super wip-y, need to formalize this page*
- currently hosted in a github repository
- forked from **maximevaillancourt** [digital garden template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
- ^ i first encountered the template above from **[talyssa's digital garden](https://talyssagarden.netlify.app/)** & was immediately inspired to finally launch this. a lot of my initial design choices were based from talyssa's (especially the home/index page) so - thank you for inspiring me finally take the leap!
- i'm super inspired by **muan**'s [site](https://github.com/muan/site). i want to implement the openheart protocol in the future...
